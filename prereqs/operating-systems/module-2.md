# Module 2: CPU Scheduling Concepts

## 2.0 Overview

+CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient.
+Whenever the CPU becomes idle, the operating system must select one of the processes in the **ready queue** to be executed. The selection process is carried out by the CPU scheduler. The scheduler selects from among the processes in memory that are ready to execute, and allocates the CPU to one of them.
